<h1>I am a Problem1 component</h1>
<span>Link to Problem1Child: </span> <a router-link="problem1-child">Problem1Child</a>
<p>
    Exception is raised in console.<br>
    Since the route to <b>Problem1Child</b> is configured in <b>@RouteConfig</b> of <b>App</b> component the router throws an error.
    It seems like it cant bubble up the routing from <b>Problem1</b> to <b>App</b>
